The study group—\\ncomprising nine senior leaders experienced in US-Africa policy and relations—participated in four\\nexploratory meetings from June through October 2023. During the course of the study, multiple inter-\\nviews with relevant technical, operational, and policy experts were also conducted. Through these\\nactivities, the study group developed a set of 13 consensus recommendations for the United States to\\nsupport mutually beneficial public and private partnerships with African countries as the United States\\nendeavors to diversify its access to minerals deemed critical to US economic and national security.\\nCover includes artwork by Unleashed Design/Shutterstock.\\n© 2024 by the United States Institute of Peace\\nUnited States Institute of Peace\\n2301 Constitution Avenue NW\\nWashington, DC 20037\\nPhone: 202.457.1700\\nFax: 202.429.6063\\nE-mail: usip_requests@usip.org\\nWeb: www.usip.org\\nFirst published April 2024\\nISBN: 978-1-60127-935-4Critical Minerals\\nin Africa\\nStudy Group Members\\nEdward A.
